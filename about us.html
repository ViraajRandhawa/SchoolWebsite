			<p>In 1964, a young visionary, suffused with the fervour of nationalism, left a lucrative career and stepped into the realm of education to establish "The Tagore <br>
			   Education Society". Founded by Dr. (Mrs.) Hari Sen and Mr. Jitender Sen, the society adopted three goals: academic excellence, the spirit of innovation and <br>
			   the zeal to impart value-based education <br>
				Tagore Schools have left indelible footprints on the sands of time. The journey began with a small school in Lajpat Nagar in the year 1964 which later got a <br>
				 bigger campus at East of Kailash. Prompted by its success, the society decided to set up another school in Vasant Vihar. Today, Tagore International <br>
				 Schools are renowned for its disciplined yet nurturing environment wherein students imbibe noble values, strive towards brilliance and cultivate an insight <br>
				  about the social concerns.</p>
